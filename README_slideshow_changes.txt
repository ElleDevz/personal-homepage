Updated slideshow.css to a more modern, developer-focused style:

- Added CSS variables and box-shadow for a modern card look.
- Added subtle fade-in animation for active slides.
- Improved image handling (object-fit, scale on hover) to look crisp.
- Restyled navigation buttons as circular controls with focus styles.
- Added dot indicators styling for quick navigation.
- Responsive tweaks for small screens.

If you'd like I can also wire up dot indicators in the HTML/JS or add keyboard navigation support in script.js.
